# Profile Access Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Route Modifications (`routes/web.php`)

-   **Removed** profile routes from the `prevent.admin` middleware group
-   **Added** new profile routes group with only `auth` middleware, allowing Admin access:
    ```php
    // Profile Routes - Accessible by all authenticated users including Admin
    Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
        Route::get('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'edit'])->name('profile.edit');
        Route::patch('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'update'])->name('profile.update');
        // Note: Delete account route removed as per requirements
    });
    ```
-   **Removed** the delete account route (`Route::delete('/profile', ...)`)

### 2. Profile View Modifications (`resources/views/profile/edit.blade.php`)

-   **Removed** the delete account section from the profile edit page
-   Profile page now only shows:
    -   Profile Information update form
    -   Password update form

### 3. Controller Modifications (`app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`)

-   **Commented out** the `destroy` method to disable account deletion functionality
-   Added documentation note explaining the functionality has been disabled

### 4. Test Modifications (`tests/Feature/ProfileTest.php`)

-   **Commented out** tests related to account deletion functionality
-   Added documentation note explaining why tests were disabled

## Functionality Available to Admin Users

✅ **Admin users can now access:**

-   Profile page (`/profile`)
-   Update profile information (name, email)
-   Change password

❌ **Removed functionality:**

-   Delete account (completely removed)

## Technical Details

### Access Control

-   **Before:** Profile routes used `prevent.admin` middleware, blocking admin access
-   **After:** Profile routes use only `auth` middleware, allowing all authenticated users including admins

### Navigation

-   Profile link in the dropdown menu is automatically available to admin users
-   No additional navigation changes needed since admin dashboard uses the same layout (`x-app-layout`)

### Security

-   Password change functionality remains secure with proper validation
-   All existing security measures for profile updates are maintained
-   Only the dangerous account deletion functionality was removed

## Testing

-   Routes properly registered: ✅
-   No PHP syntax errors: ✅
-   Configuration cached: ✅
-   Routes cached: ✅

## Files Modified

1. `routes/web.php` - Route definitions
2. `resources/views/profile/edit.blade.php` - Main profile view
3. `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php` - Controller logic
4. `tests/Feature/ProfileTest.php` - Test cases

All changes maintain existing functionality for regular users while extending access to Admin position users and removing the delete account feature as requested.
